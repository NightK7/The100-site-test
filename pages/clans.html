                <h2>Les 13 clans:</h2>
                <h3>Trikru</h3>
                <p>The Woods Clan, also known as People of the Woods, Trigedakru, Trikru, or Tree People, are a group of
                    Grounders who inhabited the expanse of Virginia's woodlands. Their borders also extended to the
                    ruins of what once was Washington, DC and near the ruins of the Lincoln Memorial. In "Remember Me",
                    it is revealed that Lincoln's village was named Tondc, probably due to a damaged sign nearby that
                    read "Washington DC 10 Miles." The name "Tondc" is from the five last letters in Washington DC.

                    Commander Lexa, the founder of the Coalition, was from the Woods Clan.
                </p>
                <h3>Azgeda</h3>
                <p>
                    The Ice Nation, also known as Azgeda in Trigedasleng, is a clan that was ruled by Queen Nia and
                    later King Roan. The Ice Nation's territory stretched for a thousand miles. It bordered Trikru
                    territory at Sector 8, but the ice was farther to the north. This clan was in the land where the
                    Southern Canadian and Northern U.S. borders met.

                    Prior to joining the Coalition, this clan had been at war with Trikru. Under Queen Nia, the Ice
                    Nation had captured Lexa's girlfriend, Costia, thinking she had information about the Commander.
                    They tortured, killed, and decapitated her. The Ice Nation joined the Coalition around 2147, though
                    Nia was forced to banish her son, Roan, as part of a deal with Lexa.

                    Ontari, the pretender to the Commander's throne upon Lexa's death, was from the Ice Nation.
                </p>
                <h3>Floukru</h3>
                <p>
                    The Boat People, also known as Floudon Kru or Floukru,[8] was a clan led by Luna.[9] This clan was
                    allied with Trikru and, according to Lincoln in "I Am Become Death", they live "east to the sea,
                    then across it." Floukru lived on an old oil rig in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and used boats
                    for transportation to land.

                    Floukru were a pacifist clan that avoided war and violence. Lincoln had met Luna on his travels,[10]
                    and was going to take Octavia to Floukru in order to keep her out of the conflict between the 100
                    and the Grounders, though the two never made it. In "Wanheda (Part 1)", it is alluded that once the
                    Commander placed the kill order on Lincoln's head, Luna was no longer willing to take them in.

                    In "The Four Horsemen", Luna became the last surviving member of the Floukru clan when the rest of
                    her people died from radiation sickness after ingesting irradiated fish. Luna only overcame the
                    sickness on account of her being a Nightblood. When Luna was killed by Octavia in "Die All, Die
                    Merrily" during the Final Conclave, Floukru became extinct.
                </p>
                <h3>Sangedakru</h3>
                <p>
                    The Desert Clan, also known as Sankru or Sangedakru (sometimes misspelled "Sandgedakru")[11], lived
                    in, and are named after, the desert near the Dead Zone, but are separate from the Nomadic Grounders
                    who inhabited the Dead Zone. According to Brell, the clan's capital punishment is stoning to death.

                    Sheidheda was a Commander from Sangedakru, and the clan's greatest champion.

                    Trishanakru was one of the allies Trikru called upon to help retake Polis from Azgeda.[12]

                    The clan's death ritual includes securing the dead body against a tree and having radiated glowing
                    butterflies place their larvae to make a cocoon around the body. After metamorphosis, glowing
                    butterflies emerge from the cocoon. The butterflies give the clan their name.[13]

                    them.[15] They were allied with Trikru and were willing to fight against Azgeda.[14]

                    In the episode, "A Little Sacrifice", it was revealed that a Boudalankru member named Maffei, was a
                    Nightblood, who became a Commander.
