                        <h3>Trikru</h3>
                        <p>The Woods Clan, also known as People of the Woods, Trigedakru, Trikru, or Tree People, are a
                            group of Grounders who inhabited the expanse of Virginia's woodlands. Their borders also
                            extended to the ruins of what once was Washington, DC and near the ruins of the Lincoln
                            Memorial. In "Remember Me", it is revealed that Lincoln's village was named Tondc, probably
                            due to a damaged sign nearby that read "Washington DC 10 Miles." The name "Tondc" is from
                            the five last letters in Washington DC.
                            Commander Lexa, the founder of the Coalition, was from the Woods Clan.

                        <h3>Skaikru</h3>
                        <p>The Sky People, also known as Skaikru, joined the Coalition as the thirteenth clan in 2150.
                            Sky People, or Skaikru (Trigedasleng), is a term used by the Grounders to describe a person
                            who came from the Ark. They are also commonly known as Arkers and on at least one occasion
                            as Arkadians. The Sky People are descendants of humans who survived the Nuclear Apocalypse
                            97
                            years prior
                            because they were already living in space or managed to escape in shuttles.[1][2]
                            With almost a century since the Apocalypse, the Ark merely needed to survive another two
                            hundred years to ensure that the ground is viable for life. Little did most of the Ark
                            population
                            know that oxygen was running out, and soon enough, they would be forced to take their very
                            homes
                            through reentry, and begin life on the ground.
                            After the Final Conclave, the Sky People were dissolved and merged with the remaining eleven
                            Grounder clans to form Wonkru.

                        <h3>Azgeda</h3>
                        <p>The Ice Nation, also known as Azgeda in Trigedasleng, is a clan that was ruled by Queen Nia
                            and
                            later King Roan. The Ice Nation's territory stretched for a thousand miles. It bordered
                            Trikru
                            territory at Sector 8, but the ice was farther to the north. This clan was in the land where
                            the
                            Southern Canadian and Northern U.S. borders met.

                            Prior to joining the Coalition, this clan had been at war with Trikru. Under Queen Nia, the
                            Ice
                            Nation had captured Lexa's girlfriend, Costia, thinking she had information about the
                            Commander.
                            They tortured, killed, and decapitated her. The Ice Nation joined the Coalition around 2147,
                            though
                            Nia was forced to banish her son, Roan, as part of a deal with Lexa.

                            Ontari, the pretender to the Commander's throne upon Lexa's death, was from the Ice Nation.

                        <h3>Floukru</h3>
                        <p>The Boat People, also known as Floudon Kru or Floukru,[8] was a clan led by Luna.[9] This
                            clan was
                            allied with Trikru and, according to Lincoln in "I Am Become Death", they live "east to the
                            sea,
                            then across it." Floukru lived on an old oil rig in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and
                            used boats
                            for transportation to land.

                            Floukru were a pacifist clan that avoided war and violence. Lincoln had met Luna on his
                            travels,[10]
                            and was going to take Octavia to Floukru in order to keep her out of the conflict between
                            the 100
                            and the Grounders, though the two never made it. In "Wanheda (Part 1)", it is alluded that
                            once the
                            Commander placed the kill order on Lincoln's head, Luna was no longer willing to take them
                            in.

                            In "The Four Horsemen", Luna became the last surviving member of the Floukru clan when the
                            rest of
                            her people died from radiation sickness after ingesting irradiated fish. Luna only overcame
                            the
                            sickness on account of her being a Nightblood. When Luna was killed by Octavia in "Die All,
                            Die
                            Merrily" during the Final Conclave, Floukru became extinct.

                            lived

                            who inhabited the Dead Zone. According to Brell, the clan's capital punishment is stoning to
                            death.

                            Sheidheda was a Commander from Sangedakru, and the clan's greatest champion.

                        <p>The Glowing Forest, also known as Trishana or Trishanakru, is where Ilian is from. Some
                            members of
                            Trishanakru have been known to decorate themselves with lines of dots tattooed onto their
                            foreheads.
                            Trishanakru was one of the allies Trikru called upon to help retake Polis from Azgeda.[12]

                            The clan's death ritual includes securing the dead body against a tree and having radiated
                            glowing
                            butterflies place their larvae to make a cocoon around the body. After metamorphosis,
                            glowing
                            butterflies emerge from the cocoon. The butterflies give the clan their name.

                        <p>Mountain Men, or Maunon (Trigedasleng), is a term used by the Sky People and the Grounders to
                            describe the group of people who resided in Mount Weather. The Mountain Men are descendants
                            of the
                            United States Government and others who survived the Nuclear Apocalypse by seeking shelter
                            within
                            Mount Weather. They were exterminated by the Sky People at the conclusion of their conflict.

                            The Mountain Men are responsible for creating the Acid Fog that has killed numerous
                            Outsiders, as
                            well as the creation of the Reapers who helped them capture their fellow Grounders for the

                            Men's blood harvesting program. Because of this, the Grounders and the Mountain Men have an
                            antagonistic relationship. After the events of "Fog of War", part of the remaining
                            Delinquents find
                            out about what the Mountain Men have done and they no longer see them as their salvation.

                            the Eligius III's Mission Team Alpha. They built a sanctuary and a microstate, known as
                            Sanctum, and
                            protected it with a radiation shield dome to keep their people safe. Inside Sanctum, the
                            Primes are
                            revered as divine, royal and therefore leaders among the Sanctumites. The Primes have lived
                            on for
                            generations by transferring their consciousness into new black blood hosts during a holy,
                            Naming Day
                            ceremony. Only people with Royal Blood (Nightblood) can serve as hosts for the Primes.
